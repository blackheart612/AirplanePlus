	description = The 220-KE APE is the bigger brother of the 100-KE. On production lines of Kerbal Standard, intern Kerbals are often deployed due to help the youth learn and not due to lack of workforce. There are often mistakes on creation in terms of scale, these are then repurposed and modified to work on the closest bulkhead which is Size 1.5. It works so far. No refunds.
