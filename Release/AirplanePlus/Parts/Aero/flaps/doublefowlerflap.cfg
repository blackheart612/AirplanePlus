	title = Trailing Edge Two-slot Flap
	manufacturer = Kerbal Standard
	description = There is no greater flap than a two-slot flap, other than a flap that has more slots. Though two-slotted flaps are already enormous. This flap is generally put in the trailing edge or the back part of the wing. Not that it's a mandatory issue, it's just like that on the manual. Usage can range to reaction with pitch to help in take-offs or be used for landing in full deployment. Can sometimes be used for subtle changes in cruise speeds as well. This two slot flap has two surfaces which can be deployed individually. Hence, it is more versatile.
