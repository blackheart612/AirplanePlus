	description = The Supplementary Part Operation In Lift Express Reduction (S.P.O.I.L.E.R) works just like how it is in the tin. Say you want some additional devices as you have more lift than you want to have. Aside from other methods, this method of lift dumping is one of the simpler ones. Unlike A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S, the plan is to not just add drag. Go fly it and see if it's actually true.
