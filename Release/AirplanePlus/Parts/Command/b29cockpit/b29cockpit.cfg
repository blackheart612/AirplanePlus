	manufacturer = Kerbal Standard
	description = Offers more room than you can imagine on the cockpit, more kerbals to fit in. Up to for crew members in the cockpit and the view is better than any. Features an almost full glass cockpit you'd think that it could just all have been glass but there is enough part stress as it is for the structural integrity it might just disassemble itself. Though the last part is not that important when in flight.
