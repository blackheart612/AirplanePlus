	description = Take an Elevon 2B and refurbish it to have a greater angle to increase the wing's camber. The mechanism hinders moving in two angles but it works so it's out for the market. This flap is generally put in the trailing edge or the back part of the wing. Not that it's a mandatory issue, it's just like that on the manual. Usage can range to reaction with pitch to help in take-offs or be used for landing in full deployment. Can sometimes be used for subtle changes in cruise speeds as well.
