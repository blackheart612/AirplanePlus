	description = The length of the 1.875m Liquid Fuel Fuselage Junior is basically the half of its regular counterpart. Smaller lengths are usually easier to manufacture due to the amount of parts that could be used to recycle it. Most badly damaged parts of a tank could be cut down and still make a Junior fuselage.
