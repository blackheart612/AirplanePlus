	description = Specifically made for the sole purpose of being able to break the sound barrier but it doesn't mean it should. The weight has been reduced as much as possible with stripping out all the materials off the cockpit. There is much glass just in case there is need to check out what is happening to the rest of the atmosphere if ever a fortunate kerbal is indeed at literal breakneck speed.
