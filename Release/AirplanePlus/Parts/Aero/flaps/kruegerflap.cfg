	description = Sometimes incredible effort is needed to make a statement. This this flap is made. The show-off mechanism of such complex operation is there basking in all its glory when deployed. This flap is generally put in the leading edge or the front part of the wing. Not that it's a mandatory issue, it's just like that on the manual. Usage can range to reaction with pitch to help in take-offs or be used for landing in full deployment. Can sometimes be used for subtle changes in cruise speeds as well.
