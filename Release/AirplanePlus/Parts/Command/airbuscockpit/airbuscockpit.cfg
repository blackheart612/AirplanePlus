	description = It carries 2 kerbals and looks very bulky. Its control is great but the roll. It was always a wonder why Mk2 sizes was not a cylinder shape with 2.5m diameter but Kerbal Standard has made a Size 2 cockpit to accomodate the missing piece. Not just that but we're also on sale. It is a cheaper alternative to Mk2.
